There isn't a deadline for the first project yet. How are deadlines determined? 
Will some projects have a set deadline as they are introduced?
:::

I will usually post projects descriptions initially without deadlines, so they can serve 
as a reference to what we are working on. We will then go through some tools 
and exercises related to the project. Once we will finish this background 
work, I will set the deadline for the project. You will then have a week or so 
to finish the work on the project, write a report, and submit it.

How complex will this course get? I know coding could be very difficult when you get more in depth, 
I was wondering how far this course will take us.
:::

As the course progresses, we will be covering more programming tools, but we will not get 
into very complex coding topics. The goal of this course is to give you practical experience 
how to use programming as a tool for scientific computing and data analysis. 
With Python, it is possible to accomplish a lot with relatively simple code.

In what instance would you use a tuple vs. a list and vice versa? 
:::

The difference between tuples and lists is that lists can be modified after they 
are created - they can be made longer or shorter, and their elements can be changed.
Tuples, on the other hand, can't be changed once they are created.

Lists are useful when we are creating a collection of objects and we don't know 
in advance how many objects we will have or what will be these objects. For example, 
when we are computing a Collatz sequence, we don't know how many numbers will be in 
the sequence ahead of time - we just keep adding numbers to a list until we reach 1.

Tuples are useful for storing data that should not change throughout the program. 
For example, in a program that processes data of some people, it makes sense to store 
the name, the date of birth, and the address of each person as a tuple. This assures 
that this data can be accessed, but it will not be accidentally modified by the program.

Can we get a concrete due date or some better directions for the collatz sequence project? 
So far, the page says we should only pick "a few" of the questions to answer. How many is a few? 
Also, I understand that we need to keep a rigorous pace in this course, but could you spend 
a little more time explaining the logic and ordering of the longer functions that we're writing? 
I seem to be struggling to understand why some lines go in certain places and not others. 
:::

I will talk this week about the Collatz projects and expectations on projects reports. 
I will try to spend more time explaining the code, but if you feel uncertain or have any 
questions, please interrupt me at any time and ask. If you have a question after class, 
post it on Piazza. I can also help either after class or during my office hours too.

In what way are we going to use python code to implement mathematical functions? 
What mathematical theories or functions are we to be implementing into our code?
:::

It will go similarly to what we have been doing so far. We will be working on various
projects related to mathematics and its applications, and we will use Python to perform 
computations that let us explore these projects. 


## Daniel

When is the first project report due?
:::

We will see how far we get on Tuesday. You will always have at least a week after I announce 
the project due date to finish the work and write the report.

What does the Jupyter notebook allow us to do that other programs can't? How are Collatz sequences 
used in real life situations? Is there a way can we apply the Collatz sequence to help answer 
math-related questions?
:::

Most code editors allow one to write and run code. Jupyter notebooks are useful, because they
allow us to combine code, text, and images in one document. 

I don't know of any real-life applications of Collatz sequences. They are a mathematical puzzle
that seems very simple, but has been unsolved for a long time. If we will know how to solve 
problems like this, then we may be able to use similar ideas to solve real-life problems.

How will we be incorporating the use of python and jupyter for math in this course? 
:::

It will go similarly to what we have been doing so far. We will be working on various
projects related to mathematics and its applications, and we will use Python to perform 
computations that let us explore these projects.
