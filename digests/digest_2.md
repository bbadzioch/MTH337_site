# Weekly digest 2

Does the Collatz sequences require us to make new code or can we just use code 
we've made in class?
:::

What code you will need, depends on what you want to include in your project report. 
You can use the code written in class, but you may also need to add additional code
that you write on your own. 


## Christian

What is the most difficult or challenging topic that we will cover in this course?
:::

I don't think that there will be a specific topic much more difficult than the rest. 


## Alan

:::{epigraph}
Could you please give us some more direction on what to do in the report? Perhaps 
either by posting the example reports you showed in class or making your own sample 
report of a different topic? 
:::

I explained what I would like to see in these reports in class on Tuesday. If you have 
some specific questions, let me know. See also the Project Report Guide posted on the 
course website. At the end of the guide there are links to some Jupyter notebooks files, 
that have the general structure that I would expect to see in a good report. A couple of 
these notebooks are much longer that a report should be, but the one on news categorization 
is of a reasonable length. The general expectation is that you should do some explorations 
of the project and describe them in a clear and interesting way.

Can you post on UBLearns when all of our projects for the semester are due, or are projects 
due around three weeks after new material is learned?
:::


In general, a report should be due every other week. I don't want to post all due dates 
up front, since some material may take more (or less) time than I expect, and that will 
affect when the corresponding report will be due.


## Jaimie

:::{epigraph}
The Collatz project seems to be very open in the sense that you gave us many suggestions to research 
and include in our code. Will all projects be this way? 
:::

Some projects may be more specific, but the general idea is, that projects in this course 
should give you an opportunity to explore something on your own. Thus, they are open-ended 
by design. 


## Shane

When running a code produces an error, is there any specific easy way to read the error for a fix 
as sometimes I will read the error and not exactly know what was wrong with what I typed?
:::

Error messages are helpful, but it is not always easy to figure out from an error message what 
exactly went wrong and how to fix it. Also, an error message will indicate the line of code 
where the error was encountered, but sometimes the real reason for the error will be in 
a different part of the code. Many errors are caused by typos and they are easy to spot, 
but some errors are tricky to figure out and may require some thinking and experimentation. 


## Ryan

What are multidimensional Numpy Arrays and in what ways can I implement them in order to help 
me with the first project?
:::

I will explain what numpy arrays (including multidimensional ones) are in class this week. 
They are not needed for the first project, but they will be needed for the next one. 


## Jenna

:::{epigraph}
How much time do you recommend taking to work on the first project?
:::

It should be doable in 3-4 hours, but it may take more or less time depending what you decide 
to include, your coding background etc. 


## Brianna

:::{epigraph}
The only question I can think of for now is how can someone learning java equate python and 
java to make it easier for them to learn it? What's similar/what's different?
:::

Java can be somewhat more difficult to get started with than Python. For example, in Java each 
variable must be declared with the type of data it will store. A variable which is created 
to store e.g. integers cannot be used to store floats. Python is more user-friendly in this respect. 
Also, typically Python will require less code than Java to perform the same task. On the other 
hand, Java code in general will run faster (but there are ways to speed up Python code too...). 

The basic structures (variables, functions, loops, if statements etc.) work the same way in 
almost all programming languages, so if you know one of them, it is much easier to learn 
other ones. 


## Henry

:::{epigraph}
How is python used in different careers?
:::

Python is a general purpose language, so technically it can be used for any task. It is very popular 
in data science, machine learning and AI. It is very frequently used in scientific computing. 
It has good tools for backend web development. On the other hand, other languages are much more 
common in some other areas  - e.g. for creating mobile apps or high-performance games.


## Andrew

:::{epigraph}
How many projects are planned for the semester?
:::

I think around 6, but it will depend on how much time we will need on each of them. 
Some things may take either more or less time that I plan, and I will adjust the schedule 
as needed.


## Chloe

:::{epigraph}
Do we have a final exam?
:::

No, there are no exams in this course (aside from quizzes).


## Berkley

:::{epigraph}
Will the Collatz Sequence project require any graphs? Additionally, will there be any topics 
that need to be researched outside of class, or are we only including things we've worked on together?
:::


For the Collatz project some plots would be useful to illustrate computations. 
Projects reports are open-ended. You are not required to do deep research outside the class, 
but including something that that you did on your own can add value to the report. 


## Aidan

Is LaTeX formatting applicable outside of python or does notation differ in other coding languages?
:::

$\LaTeX$ is not a part of Python. It is a typesetting system commonly used in disciplines that use 
a lot of mathematical formulas (math, physics, engineering, computer science etc.). $\LaTeX$ syntax 
is also used in some other contexts, e.g. in markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook (this is what I showed in class)
or in Piazza posts. As a side note, $\LaTeX$ is also a programming language of its own right - 
one can write programs using $\LaTeX$.
