# Code structure


**Bad:** The example below includes a long block of Python code that does a lot of things 
at once: defines functions, prints and plots  data. It takes effort to unravel what is going 
on here. As a general rule, a code cell in a report should have no more than 20 lines of code, 
unless there is a very good reason for it.

**Good:** The same code as above is split into a few code cells. Beside simplifying the code 
structure, it is easier to explain what is the purpose of each bit of code.
