# Example: Report introduction


**Bad:** The introduction talks about twin primes without explaining what they are.
It lists tasks of the report without providing any context. Moreover, the emphasis of
these tasks is on explaning the Python code included in the report. This is wrong: the main
goal of a report is to research a topic using Python as a tool, not to write some Python code.
Overall, in this introduction there is no effort to present the topic of the report in an interesting way.
