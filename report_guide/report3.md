# Output formatting

**Bad:** The code prints some data, but the output is misaligned, 
there are too many decimal digits, and variable names are unnecessarily 
repeated in each row.

**Good:** The data is the same as above, but it is 
arranged into an easy to read table. Insignificant digits in 
the decimal expansion are truncated.
