# Project Report Guide


## Report grading rubrics


Detailed rubrics which will be used to grade project reports are posted
[here](./_static/report_rubrics.pdf).


## Report Style Guide

### Report introduction
A report must begin with an introduction section. 
It should explain the project and the goals of the report in a way which is 
engaging and understandable to person who does not take this course. While 
writing a report imagine that you are creating a part of a portfolio that you 
will show while applying for a job to demonstrate your skills.

The introduction of a report must not be limited to a list of tasks you want
to accomplish. While explaining the project use your own words, do not copy
the project description posted on this website. 
[Example](./report_guide/report6.md).


### Report conclusions
The final section of the report must summarize your results and conclusions.


### Report organization
Beside the introduction and conclusions, the body of the
report should be logically organized into sections. Each section 
should have a meaningful title.



### References
If you used books, articles, websites etc. while preparing the report, they should
be listed at the end of the report.



### Math formatting
Use LaTeX to format all mathematical symbols and formulas. 
[Example](report_guide/report4.md).



### Code structure 
Python code should be split into possibly short code cells that accomplish a single,
well defined task.  In particular, you should not define several functions in one cell
or define a function and execute it in the same cell.

You should explain (even if very briefly) the purpose of each piece of code. As a rule,
you should not have in a report two consecutive code cells without any text between them. 
[Example](report_guide/report7.md).


### Code sequencing
All Python code in the report must be presented in such order that it can be read
and executed sequentially, from the beginning to the end of the report. For example,
you should not use a Python function in your report prior to defining this function.
[Example](report_guide/report5.md).


### Code comments
Code comments should be used to explain workings of the code.
[Example](report_guide/report9.md).



### Execution errors
All code included in your report must work. Do not submit reports with execution errors.
[Example](report_guide/report8.md).



### Output size
Your report should contain only code output that serves some purpose
and that you expect someone to read. As a general rule, do not print more
than 30 lines of output unless you have a very good reason for it.
[Example](report_guide/report1.md)


### Output formatting
Format code output in a way that makes it easy to read.
[Example](report_guide/report3.md).



### Graphs and plots
must be well formatted. They should have titles and, if appropriate,  axis labels, a legend etc.
[Example](report_guide/report2).



## Notebook gallery


The files linked below were selected from among notebooks posted online by various
researchers and data scientists. The reports prepared for this class are **not** expected
be as long and extensive as most of these examples. What you should try to imitate is
the style: merging of the narrative with the Python code, organization of the content,
preparation of graphics, code documentation etc.
