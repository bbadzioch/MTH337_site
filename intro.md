## Instructor


Bernard Badzioch\

**Office:** 108 Mathematics Building\
**Office Hours:** Thu 2:00-4:00 PM, and by appointment


## Learning Outcomes

This course provides introduction to scientific computing using Python programming 
language. At the end of the course you should be able to use Python and its libraries 
to perform scientific computation, access, manipulate and visualize data, and apply 
some methods to perform data analysis and modeling. The work on the course projects 
you will also help you improve your technical writing skills. 


## Course Resources

**Laptop.** We will be writing code during all class meetings. For this reason you need 
to bring a laptop to each class. Any operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux) is fine.

**Software.** We will be using the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).
This is free software. Even if you have Python already installed on your computer you should install this
distribution since it includes Jupyter Notebook and several Python libraries we will need.
If you have a previous version of Python installed, please upgrade it so you don't run into
possible compatibility issues.

**Piazza.** We be using  [Piazza](https://piazza.com/buffalo/spring2026/mth337b/home) for course-related communications. 
If you have a question or comment related to the course please post it on Piazza. This will help other students who may 
face the same issue. If you know the answer to a question somebody else posted on Piazza please answer it.

If you have a personal question (concerning your grade etc.), you can either send to me a private message on Piazza or 
contact me by e-mail. 

**UBLearns.** In this course UBLearns will be used for submission of project reports only. All other course materials
will be posted on this website.



## Grading

There will be no exams in this course. Instead, grades will be assigned based on
the following components:

| Component  | Weight|
|---------|----------------|
| Project Reports | something      |
| Quizzes  | something else |
| Weekly Digests | something      |




## Project Reports

One the main components of this course will be exploratory projects. You will be
working on them largely independently, using mathematical and computing tools.
The outcome of your work on each project will be a project report that you will
submit for grading.

Each report will be graded on the A-F scale. Extra credit (a grade of A+) may
be assigned for an outstanding work. Some projects will require more effort than
others. To reflect it, each project will have a weight of up to 10 points,
with 10 points for more work-intensive projects, and fewer points for shorter
ones. The cumulative grade for all reports will be computed by:

1. converting the letter grade for each report into credits (A = 4.0, A- = 3.67, B+ = 3.33 etc.);
2. multiplying credits for each report by the report weight and adding all these
   products;
3. dividing the resulting number by the sum of weights for all reports;
4. converting the number obtained in step 3 to a letter grade.

Reports will be submitted via UBLearns. Late reports will not be accepted. 
More information about project reports is posted
:doc:`here <report_guide>`.


## Weekly digests


Each week you will be asked to submit
a short (2-3 sentences) writeup on your study from the previous week.
For example, you can write:

* what topics you have found interesting (or boring)
* what topics you have found difficult (or easy)
* how you feel about the course
* anything else you want to share.

You will be also asked to submit a question (or questions) regarding the course.

You can receive up to 10% credit for these writeups. You can miss one
such assignment without loosing any credit, but your weekly digest credit will be
lowered by 2% for each subsequent missed assignment (i.e. from 10% to 8% etc.).

I may award extra credit to students who are especially active in the course.
